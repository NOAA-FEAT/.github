## Welcome to the Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies Github Organization
We use acoustics, trawling, and other advanced technologies to study the marine ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast and support sustainable fisheries management. Our main task is to complete the [Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic Trawl Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/population-assessments/joint-us-canada-integrated-ecosystem-and-pacific-hake-acoustic). We work with Fisheries and Oceans Canada Pacific Region in support of the [U.S.-Canada Pacific Hake/Whiting Treaty](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/laws-and-policies/pacific-hake-whiting-treaty).

Since 2003, we have surveyed the migrating stock of Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), also known as Pacific whiting. We collect data using a combination of acoustic transducers and net trawling. We then analyze those data to produce an estimate of how many hake live off of the US and Canadian West Coast, called a biomass estimate. The estimate feeds into a stock assessment that is used to recommend and set harvest limits for the fishery. Along the way, we have refined and enhanced our surveys by integrating advanced technologies like underwater cameras and unmanned acoustic vehicles. Our team is also active in acoustic research and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science, and Technology.

### Research Focus Areas
- Refining and enhancing the survey, including the application of advanced technologies.
- Modernizing and processing data to make them accessible to researchers and the public.
- Evaluating the biology and ecology of California Current Large Marine Ecosystem fish and invertebrates.
